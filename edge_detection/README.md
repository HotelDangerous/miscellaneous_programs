Edge Detection: simple_cells.ipynb is a high level overview and implementation of edge detection. If you wish to run the program on your machine, be sure that the image named "natural_image_ED" and "synthetic_image_ED" are in the same directory as the interactive python notebook. I encourage you to try it with images you find interesting; just make sure you change the path in the jupyter notebook to your image.

Fair warning: the "natural_image_ED" is a high resolution image. If you want the notebook to run faster, use a smaller image.
