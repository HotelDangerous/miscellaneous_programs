    "## Building our Edge Operators\n",
    "Edge operators generally have a few common features. The first of which is that the sum of weights in our operator should be zero. Naturally this brings us to a second feature, some weights must be negative. Those weights that are negative are called *inhibitory* and act to supress the magnitude of the signal sent to our brain. Those weights that are positive are called *excitatory*, they act to increase the magnitude of the signal sent to our brain. Additionally, weights in our operators can have zero value. Zero value weights do not contribute to the magnitude of the signal sent to the brain, but can influence the scene that our operator responds to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a simple edge detector made with the intention of recognizing simple falling edges might have an archetecture in which the inhibitory -negatively weighted- region is on the right hand side of the operator and the excitatory on the left:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1    &0    &-1\\\\\n",
    "1    &0    &-1\\\\\n",
    "1    &0    &-1\\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    ">When the signal generated by a simple cell like this is negative, the signal is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we can create the rising edge operator by multiplying each element by $-1$; effectively swapping the placement of the excitatory and inhibitory regions. But this is not necessary because we are using computers and not cells, we can take the absolute value of the signal produced by our operator. This is an advantage because now the operator displayed above can detect both rising and falling verticle edges. This also saves us from having to convolve both operators across the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can convolve our first operator we need to define a threshold. Almost every step in the convolution will result in a value, it is our job to decide at which signal strength we wish to declare that an edge exists. If we choose a higher value, our operator will find a smaller number of edges, but the edges it does find will be well pronounced. If our threshold is small, then our operator will find many edges-- even where they don't exist. Despite having these general rules, we don't have a law describing how we should choose a threshold.\n",

    "It seems sensible to me to set the threshold to the average pixel value in the image. So lets find that threshold for each image."

Thus we will have to take some artistic liberties in defining this next set of operators.\n",

Because we do not have enough rows or columns to make a clear line of $0$'s we identify the angle by first creating a line of three zeros, in the center, either vertically or horizontally, and then offset the last $0$ in the direction we want to lean toward.\n",

Hence the right most $0$ is in the last column and second to last row and the leftmost zero is in the first column and second row. To create operators for the other three intermediate directions, we can just flip this matrix according to our goal.\n",
